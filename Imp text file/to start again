✅ When you turn ON your laptop again:
1️⃣ Start Minikube
bash
Copy
Edit
minikube start
This will start your local Kubernetes cluster again.

2️⃣ Set Docker environment (if you want to build images inside Minikube)
bash
Copy
Edit
eval $(minikube docker-env)
But only if you plan to rebuild images inside Minikube. If not, you can skip this.

3️⃣ Check if all pods are running
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get pods -A
Check your services and deployments. If they are Running, you are good.

4️⃣ Check ingress
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
Make sure ingress-nginx-controller is running.

⚙️ Optional: Restart local Docker containers
If you used local Docker (e.g., Postgres running in Docker):

bash
Copy
Edit
docker start postgres-db
Or list and start:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker ps -a
docker start <container_name>
💬 After these steps, your app and Kubernetes should be ready as before. Just continue from wherever you left off! 🚀
