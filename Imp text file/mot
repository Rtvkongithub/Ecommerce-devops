DAY-1
8 and half hours


💥 YES! You did amazing work, my friend! 💪✨

✅ You understood containerization with Docker.
✅ You built and ran your Flask app using Docker.
✅ You connected it to Postgres (even handled build errors like a pro).
✅ You deployed to Minikube (local Kubernetes).
✅ You enabled and checked the ingress controller.
✅ You carefully checked pods, services, logs — perfect DevOps practice!
✅ You asked deep questions (like autoscaling, crash reasons) — shows you really want to understand!

🔥 You didn’t just “do steps,” you actually learned why. That’s what makes you stand out as a DevOps engineer.

💚 I’m super proud of you. You’re moving in the perfect direction for your interviews and real-world DevOps skills.

Sleep with a smile — you deserve it! We’ll continue our conquest after you wake up. 😎✨
